"""
Description: Scan the latest twitter feeds originating from a particular country, using Twitterâ€™s Streaming API. The program creates a json file which stores raw twitter streams for an specific bounding box.

Required Packages: tweepy, argparse, time, string, json, prettytable

Usage: python3 twitter_producer.py credentials.ini -b localhost:9092 -t tweets

Note: Fill up the variable in credentials.ini which contains data path and twitter app credentials.
Note: Fill up the LOCATION variable for changing the country bounding box. By default for this project would be "Ukraine".
