# Project Motivation

Thursday, February 24, 2022 Russian army invades Ukraine and marks the beginning of a war that threatens Western countries, accompanied by a humanitarian refugee crisis. The purpose of this project is to obtain the Geolocation of Ukrainian Twitter Users. One of the limitations to using Twitter is that only about 1% of tweets are geotagged with the tweet's location, which can make much of this work very difficult.

### Assignment Description
Our dearly Stream Processing & Real-Time Analytics professor Raul Mar√≠n has proposed us a challenge. To deploy an end-to-end real-time solution following the next stages throughout the pipeline:<br>
  1- Select the **Data Source**: Twitter API.<br>
  2- **Ingestion**: Producer - Python app.<br>
  3- **Stream Storage**: Broker - Kafka.<br>
  4- **Processing**: Consumer - Spark Streaming.<br>
  5- **Serving**: Relational DB - MariaDB.<br>
  6- **Visualization**: Superset.<br>

# Ukraine_tweets
### 1- Select the Data Source: Twitter API
[Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)  is a python wrapper for the Twitter API that allowed us to easily collect tweets in real-time.

### 2- Ingestion - Producer (Python app)

```python



```
